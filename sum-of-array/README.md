## Task: Write an iterative and a recursive solution to this challenge. 

## Question: I have an array of numbers and strings. If each letter in the string correlates to a number, (a=1, b=2 ... z=26, A=27, B=28...Y=51, Z=52) what is the total of the following array? 
```
value_array = [1, 'all', 4, 53, 'Cats', 24, 'Bilbo Swaggins', 12, 74, 'Wowwie', 23, 60, 13, 46, 'That is amazing']
```
