## Manhattan Distance / Taxicab geometry 
is a form of geometry in which the usual distance function or metric of Euclidean geometry is replaced by a new metric in which the distance between two points is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. 

Create a grid (i.e. 5 x 5 )

Allow input of point/pixel/dot (i.e. [1,3] )

Allow input of blur size (i.e. blur(4) )

### Example:

```
[0,0,1,0,0,0]
[0,1,1,1,0,0]
[1,1,1,1,1,0]
[0,1,1,1,0,0]
[0,0,1,0,0,0]
```
