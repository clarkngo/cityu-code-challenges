In this kata you will have to calculate fib(n) where:

````
fib(0) := 0
fib(1) := 1
fin(n + 2) := fib(n + 1) + fib(n)
````
Write an algorithm that can handle n up to 2000000.

Your algorithm must output the exact integer answer, to full precision. Also, it must correctly handle negative numbers as input.

HINT I: Can you rearrange the equation fib(n + 2) = fib(n + 1) + fib(n) to find fib(n) if you already know fib(n + 1) and fib(n + 2)? Use this to reason what value fib has to have for negative values.
